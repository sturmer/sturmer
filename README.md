### Welcome!

I work as a software engineer for a company called [Glia](https://www.glia.com/), that however used to be called Salemove and so that's the name of the organization I use on GitHub.

I write Elixir, Ruby, and JavaScript. I like [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Previously I've worked in hospitality, banking, urban mobility, and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/).

I'm a grad school dropout but I don't give up easily.

#### Naming

My complete name is long and Italian but I rarely use it (except when I sign contracts or talk with my mamma). I go by **Gian** (/'dʒɒn/).

When I have to choose a nickname I go by `sturmer` (without the umlaut) or `increatore`.

<!--
**sturmer/sturmer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
