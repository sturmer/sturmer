### Hi!

I'm Gian and I work as an Engineering Manager for [Glia](https://www.glia.com/).

I write in Elixir, Ruby, and (as little as possible) JavaScript. I like [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Previously I've worked in hospitality, banking, urban mobility, and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/).

I'm a grad school dropout but I don't give up easily.

#### Web

I own the domains [gergel.im](https://www.gergel.im) and [ciccarelli.dev](https://ciccarelli.dev). One is hosted by GitHub Pages, the other by Netlify. My provider is [Gandi](https://gandi.net).

#### Naming

My complete name is long and Italian but I rarely use it (except when I sign contracts or talk with my mamma). I go by just **Gian** (/'d í…ín/).

When I have to choose a nickname I go by `sturmer` or `increatore`.
