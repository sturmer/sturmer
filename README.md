### Hi!

I'm Gian and I work as a Software Engineer in [Glia](https://www.glia.com/).

I write code mostly in Elixir, sometimes in Ruby, and JavaScript only if I can't help it.

Before joining Glia, I've worked in [hospitality](https://amadeus.com/en), [banking](https://allitude.it/), [urban mobility](https://bolt.eu/), and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/).

#### Web

I own the domain [ciccarelli.dev](https://ciccarelli.dev), hosted by Netlify. My provider is [Gandi](https://gandi.net).

#### Naming

My complete name is long and Italian but I rarely use it (except when I sign contracts or talk with my mamma). I go by just **Gian** (/'d í…ín/).

When I have to choose a nickname I pick `sturmer` or `increatore`.
