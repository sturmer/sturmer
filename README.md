### Hi!

I'm Gian and I work as a Software Engineer in [Glia](https://www.glia.com/).

I write code mostly in Elixir, sometimes in Ruby, and JavaScript only if I can't help it.

Before joining Glia, I've worked in [hospitality]([url](https://amadeus.com/en)), [banking]([url](https://allitude.it/)), [urban mobility]([url](https://bolt.eu/)), and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/).

I'm a grad school dropout but I don't give up easily.

#### Web

I own the domains [gergel.im](https://www.gergel.im) and [ciccarelli.dev](https://ciccarelli.dev). One is hosted by GitHub Pages, the other by Netlify. My provider is [Gandi](https://gandi.net).

#### Naming

My complete name is long and Italian but I rarely use it (except when I sign contracts or talk with my mamma). I go by just **Gian** (/'d í…ín/).

When I have to choose a nickname I go by `sturmer` or `increatore`.
