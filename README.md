### Hi!

My name is Gian and I am a Software Engineer.

I've worked in [hospitality](https://amadeus.com/en), [banking](https://allitude.it/), [urban mobility](https://bolt.eu/), [Glia](https://www.glia.com), and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/).

#### Web

I own the domain [ciccarelli.dev](https://ciccarelli.dev), hosted by Netlify. My provider is [Gandi](https://gandi.net).

#### Naming

My complete name is long and Italian but I rarely use it (except when I sign contracts or talk with my mamma). I go by just **Gian** (/'dʒɒn/).

When I have to choose a nickname I pick `sturmer` or `increatore`.

**sturmer/sturmer** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
